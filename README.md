# TensorTraffic: AI-Powered Civic Incident Reporting & Analysis Platform

TensorTraffic is a full-stack web application built with Next.js that allows users to report, view, and analyze civic incidents in real-time. It leverages the power of Generative AI to analyze incident reports, identify trends, provide predictive alerts, and offer a suite of tools for enhancing public safety and awareness.

The application uses **Firebase Firestore** as its backend for data storage, **Google Maps Platform** for all geospatial features, **Genkit (with Gemini)** for AI-powered analysis, **Perplexity AI** for real-time web searches, and **ElevenLabs** for automated voice calls.

## Key Features

### Core Incident Management
- **üì∏ AI-Powered Incident Reporting**: Users can upload an image or video of an incident (e.g., water logging, accident), provide a description, and select a location. A Genkit AI flow analyzes the media and text to automatically categorize the incident, assess its severity, and generate a detailed report.
- **üó∫Ô∏è Interactive Incidents Map**: All reported incidents are displayed on an interactive map. Users can filter incidents by category and view details in a dialog.
- **üî• Community-Sourced Data**: The platform includes community features like upvoting and commenting on incidents, helping to verify and add context to reports.
- **üíæ Firestore Backend**: All incident data, comments, and upvotes are securely stored and retrieved from Firebase Firestore.

### Advanced AI & Data Analysis
- **üìà Analytics Dashboard**: A dedicated page visualizes incident data with charts showing breakdowns by category and day of the week.
- **‚ú® AI Trend Analysis**: An AI flow analyzes the entire incident dataset to identify hotspots, recurring problems, and other key trends, presenting them in a clear, narrative summary.
- **üß† Predictive Alerts**: Users can see incidents within a radius of their current location. An AI flow analyzes these nearby incidents to predict immediate consequences, secondary effects (like traffic on alternate routes), and offer actionable safety advice.
- **ü§ñ Live Agent**: Users can search for any location to get real-time, AI-analyzed summaries of live events sourced from the web, including traffic disruptions and power outages.

### Route & Safety Features
- **üöó Route Safety Alerts**: Before starting a journey, users can input a start and end point. The application fetches the route, identifies incidents along it, and uses an AI flow to generate a concise, voice-enabled summary of potential hazards.
- **üõ°Ô∏è Parental Alerts**: A specialized version of the route alert system, designed for parents to check the route to their child's school. It includes an emergency feature to log a time-sensitive alert with authorities.

### User Experience
- **üìç Flexible Location Input**: Users can report incidents using their current GPS location or by manually selecting a point on a map, which includes a place search feature.
- **üì± Responsive Design**: The application is fully responsive and provides an optimized experience for both desktop and mobile users, including a mobile-friendly navigation menu.
- **‚¨áÔ∏è Data Export**: From the analytics page, users can download the complete list of incidents as a CSV file for offline analysis.
